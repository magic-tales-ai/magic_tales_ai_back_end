In this task you MUST identify and extract a comprehensive list, precisely the one below, of story features that are essential for the successful generation of stories from a conversation wiht the user.
First, here's the comprehensive list of features you will have to extract. If the conversation DOES NOT contain specifics for any of these features, you MUST deduce them from the entire conversation and use you best judgment to provide a reasonable value or answer.
      
      1. Genre: Identify the genre or combination of genres that best fits the story based on the conversation (e.g., science fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance, thriller, historical fiction, non-fiction, poetry, script).
        - Fiction (e.g., science fiction, fantasy, mystery, romance, thriller, historical fiction)
        - Non-fiction (e.g., biography, memoir, self-help, educational)
        - Poetry
        - Script (e.g., screenplay, play)

      2. Language: Determine the target language for the story (e.g., English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, or a mix of languages where several characters speak different languages). Also, identify any specific dialect, regional variations, tone, or formality requirements.
        - Target language (e.g., English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese OR Mixed of languages where several characters speak different languages)
        - Dialect or regional variations
        - Tone and formality

      3. Length: Deduce the desired length of the story based on the user's preferences, such as reading time, word count, or directly stated number of chapters. Use the provided age group reading speeds and story type length guidelines to estimate the appropriate number of chapters ('num_chapters') for the 'start_story_generation' command.
        - The length of the story is critical and I will have to deduce the number of chapters ('num_chapters'), without neccesarly asking the user directly, but by using their prefered method to determine the length of the story; usually by providing a reading time, or even word count. But maybe I'm lucky and they can give me directly the number of chapters they'd like to have. User experiense is paramount, so extract information in a very subtle and smooth way. This number of chapters would be a requirement when I send the 'start_story_generation' command bellow.
        - Here's a list of average reading speeds based on different age groups:

            Ages 5-6:
            50-80 words per minute (wpm)

            80-130 wpm
            Typical chapter length: 200-400 words

            Ages 9-10:

            250-300 wpm
            Typical chapter length: 2,000-3,000 words

            Ages 55+:
            200-250 wpm
