Every chapter of the story could benefit from more show rather than tell. Use lots of dialogs! 
Adding vivid action scenes and character interactions could make it more engaging.
Providing more background on all characters, and their relationships, and how the environment the story takes place came to be would enrich the story.
The ending should have a clear resolution and hints of what's to come. Do NOT leave the reader hanging.
Tightening some repetitive descriptions could help pace the action better.
